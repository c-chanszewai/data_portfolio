						<h2>Short-term Rental Homes In Hong Kong</br> (LibreOffice Calc + Tableau) </h2>
						</header>
						<img src="images/thumbs/airbnb.png" alt="Airbnb Thumbnail" style="width: 340px; height: auto; padding-bottom: 50px;">
				        <p>I was interested in this project because I was planning a month-long stay and wanted to decide between renting a serviced room in a hotel or an Airbnb.</p>
						</br>
						<p>I obtained and combined three datasets from the Airbnb website, updated in June 2024. After cleaning the data using LibreOffice Calc, I used Tableau to create interactive visualizations to compare prices and ratings across different districts. However, I realized that, given Hong Kong's small size and Airbnb being just one of many accommodation options, the data might not be representative in certain areas. To address this, I included the number of rentals and reviews in the comparisons. The final visualization provides a detailed view of each individual rental.</p>
					    </br>
						<p>Half of the rental homes are located in Yau Tsim Mong, with an average price of $668 per night. Wan Chai, Central & Western, and several outlying islands each account for around 10% of rentals, with average prices of $732, $1,004, and $988, respectively. Interestingly, average review scores tend to increase along with rental prices. Specialty rentals, typically priced higher, are available across multiple districts.</p>
					    </br>
						<P>The older buildings in Yau Tsim Mong and Wan Chai make it possible to convert apartments into budget-friendly, short-term rentals, while vacation homes on the outlying islands could also be a viable business option. For short-term stays, though, I’d personally prefer hotels—the abundance of high-rise hotels in Hong Kong means that they tend to offer better value if you're not specifically after the 'local living' experience.</P>
