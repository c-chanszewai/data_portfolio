							<h2>Fictional Bookstore Inventory, Sales Records, And Customer Survey Analysis</br> (MySQL + Power BI) </h2>
						</header>
						<img src="images/thumbs/bookstore.jpg" alt="Bookstore Thumbnail" style="width: 340px; height: auto; padding-bottom: 50px;"/>
						<p>In this project, I practiced web scraping, created two mock datasets, and worked on cleaning up and manipulating data with Excel and Power Query. I also used Power BI’s analytical functions and Excel’s pivot tables to make some visualizations that tell a meaningful story.</p>
						<p>Here’s the setup: there’s a small fictional bookstore with 999 titles. I web scraped the fictional book data from books.toscrape.com using Octoparse. For the first part of the project, I put together an inventory spreadsheet and a simple August sales record. With these, I updated stock quantities and carried out some sales analysis. </p>
						<p>In the second part, I created a customer survey with 250 responses using Mockaroo (a random data generator). I used the custom list feature on the site to build weighted or dynamic distributions based on data from a 2022 Canadian book consumer survey. The survey results could suggest some marketing strategies the bookstore might consider. </p>
						
						<h4>Part 1a - Data cleaning in Excel </h4>
						<p>I started with two tables from web scraping: an inventory table with title, price, and stock quantity, and a category table with each title’s matching category. The scraped data in the inventory table needed some cleanup, so I did the following:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Used “Flash Fill” and “Find & Replace” to standardize the formatting</li>
							<li>Splitted data into separate columns with “Split Text to Columns”</li>
							<li>Checked for duplicates using “Conditioning Formatting” and “Countif”</li>
							<li>Removed unwanted characters and converted the column from text to numbers with “Substitute” and “Value”</li>
							<li>Re-categorized some titles with “Sort”</li>
							<li>Combined the two tables (Inventory and Category) with “Xlookup”</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The August sales table was put together by selecting books (based on the popular genres obtained from Seattle Library Checkout Records) using “Conditional Statements”.</p>
						
						<ul class="actions">
							<li style="margin-left: -30px;"><a href="https://1drv.ms/x/c/660b31ae363dcc31/EdLKX19A0TVAg-IM_sDWq-QBHPOb8U0G7aHJAOw3fBhVpQ?e=TOOf1Z" class="button">Go To Excel Spreadsheets</a></li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Part 1b - Stock Updating in Power Query & Sales Analysis in Power BI</h4>
						<p>After importing the combined inventory table into Power Query, I merged it with the August sales table and created a calculated column to update the stock quantity.</p>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li style="margin-left: -30px;"><a href="images/fulls/Updating Inventory In Power Query.jpg" class="button">Go To Power Query Table</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>In Power BI, I visualized the key performance indicators for August and highlighted low-stock items that needed replenishment. I found the Questions & Answers feature very helpful for letting viewers explore and interact with the sales data directly. I created some suggested titles and charts for the Q&A, but viewers can still choose what titles and charts they want to see. </p>
						<p>The Key Influencers visual provided some great insights into sales analysis, showing what factors impact the month’s profit and to what extent. For example, it showed that when the cost or the star rating of a title increased, so did its profit. The Top Segments tab revealed how a combination of factors influenced profit, pinpointing two of the most profitable segments: 1) General fiction books with cost over $33.94 and 2) “Not” general fiction books with cost above $39.15.</p>
						<p>Unfortunately, the Q&A and Key Influencers visuals aren’t supported for publishing to the web, so I shared them in PowerPoint slides instead.</p>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li style="margin-left: -30px;"><a href="https://1drv.ms/p/c/660b31ae363dcc31/EUMsYofYJVRIk-UtRHPZlrYB71KR13ZAU3rZvdhQuOIUFg?e=vqxkmm" class="button">Go To PowerPoint Slides</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>To present the key insights of the sales data, I created a summarized report in Power BI. This report features the month’s key sales figures, a replenishment list, and three visuals showing how profit related to category, cost and star rating.</p>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li style="margin-left: -30px;"><a href="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMGQ5ZWIwZTYtNjdlNS00MjhjLTk1NTEtYThkNGI5ODllMGJiIiwidCI6IjQyYjljNjJkLTRkZmQtNDczYi04YWI4LWEyMGQwNDQwMmY0OSJ9" class="button">Go To Power BI Visualizations</a></li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Part 2a - Visualizing Customer Survey Results Using Excel Pivot Tables and Charts </h4>
						<p>To create clearer charts that are easily understandable, I used “If statements” to categorize each age into one of the three age brackets, and unpivoted two columns related to library and bookstore visits.</section></p>
						<p>The Excel spreadsheets include the raw survey data, unpivoted data comparing library VS bookstore visits, various pivot tables and their corresponding charts.</p>
						<ul class="actions">
							<li style="margin-left: -30px;"><a href="https://1drv.ms/x/c/660b31ae363dcc31/EbZW1gRdlHxMjDW36bTkKnMBKTBckkoc9KPRtTJZDIPetg?e=1pJbUM" class="button">Go To Excel Spreadsheets</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>Here’s a dashboard that showcases all the charts.</p>

						<h4>Part 2b - Customer Survey Analysis </h4>
						<p>1. Who are our customers? <br>
						   Most of our customers are middle-aged females, followed closely by women aged 60 and up. The largest group has a Bachelor’s degree, making up about 50%.</p>
					
						<p>2. Are ebook sellers our biggest competitors?</br>
							In general, 29% of customers prefer ebooks while 44% still lean towards print books. Interestingly, among customers aged 34 and younger—who have either a high school diploma, an associate’s degree, or a graduate degree—a whopping 59% prefer ebooks! While this group isn’t our main customer base, it’s clear that ebooks are gaining traction with the younger generation. This signals a good opportunity for us to adapt our strategies while ensuring that our primary customers continue enjoying the experience of flipping through physical books. Some ideas could include selling ebook reader accessories and merchandise, and enhancing the in-store experience for the digital generation by providing free Wi-Fi and charging stations.
							</p>

						<p>3. Do our customers visit libraries or bookstores more often?</br>
							It’s clear that our customers frequent libraries more often. We could consider partnering with libraries to organize events, boosting their patron attendance while giving readers who don’t want to wait for popular titles a chance to purchase them from us.
							</p>

						<p>4. How can we enhance our customers' browsing and shopping experience to boost sales? </br>
							I’ve set up three slicers for the following three tables to help us focus our strategies on specific customer groups. Promotional sales are particularly valued, especially among middle-aged females (our largest patron group). Book clubs are also highly welcomed, particularly by younger customers, and can be a great way to build relationships with them. We can also redesign our genre signage to make it more visually appealing and break down general genres into sub-genres. Since our staff recommendations are appreciated, we can highlight staff picks in some of our newly featured sub-genres. Additionally, the themes of our book clubs and special offers can be centred around popular genres, which are shown in the last chart. 
							</p>
					
						<p>5. What genres are most popular among our customers? </br>
							The results can give us valuable insights into which genres we might want to expand in our stock selection and how we allocate shelf space. It’s fascinating to note that popular genres vary across different age groups, so we might consider rotating our featured genres from time to time.
